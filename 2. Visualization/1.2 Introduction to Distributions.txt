Introduction to Distributions

Describe Heights to ET

Distribution - the most basic statistical summary of a list of objects or numbers.  It is a compact description
of a list with many elements.

With categorical data, the distribution simply describes the proportions of each unique category.
ie The sex represented in the heights data set can be summarized by the proportations of each of the two 
categories, female and male:
>prop.table(table(heights$sex))
Female	Male
0.227	0.773

This two category FREQUENCE TABLE is the simplest form of a distribution we can form.
23% are females and the rest are males

When there are more categories, then a simple bar plot describes the distribution.

A more useful way to define a distribution for numerical is to define a function that reports the proportion 
of the data below a value A for all possible values of A.
This function is called a cumulative distribution function OR CDF.
F(a) = Pr(x <= a)
We define a function f of a and make that equal to the proportion of values x less than or equal to a, 
which is represented with this Pr, meaning proportion or probability, and then in parentheses the
event that we require, x <= a.

We can report the proportion of values between any two heights, say a and b, by computing f of b, 
and then subtracting f of a.
F(b) - F(a)

Because CDFs can be determined mathematically, as opposed to using data as we do here, the word empirical
is added to distinguish, and we use the term empirical CDF or ECDF.

CDF is not very popular in practice because it does not easily convey characteristics of interests, such as, at 
what value is the distribution centered, etc..

Histograms as much preferred. The simplest way to make a histogram is to divide a span of our data into 
non-overlapping bins of the same size.  Then for each bin, we count the number of values that fall in that interval.
The histogram plots these counts as bars with the base of the bar the interval.
Histogram is an approximation, it does not distinguish between 64, 64.1, and 64.2 inches. 
In this particular case, differences are negligible.

Smooth Density Plots

Smooth density plots are similar to historgrams but are aesthetically more appealing.
Y axis changed from Count to Density
When bin size gets smaller and smaller, the histogram gets smoother and smoother.
To make the curve no depend on the hypothetical size of the hypothetical list, we computer the curve on the
frequence scale rather than the count scale.

In our example, we don't have a large data set and we can't make a histogram with very very small bins.
To estimate the hypothetical smooth curve, is by making a histogram with our data, computer frequencies
rather than counts, and using the bin size appropriate for our data.
To smooth the history, we start by keeping the heights of the histogram bar with little points.
We keep these points and draw a smooth curve that goes through the top of these histogram bars.
That gives us the smooth density.

We should select a degree of smoothness that we can defend as being representative of the underlying data.

The y axis of a smooth density plot is scaled so that the area under the density curve adds up to 1.
The y axis tells u the proportion of values in that bin, but this is only true if the bin is of size 1.
For other size intervals, the best way to determine the proportation of data in that interval is by 
computing the proptional of the total area contained in that interval.


The advantage of smooth densities over histograms is that it makes it easier to compare to distribution.

Normal Distribution

Normal distribution - Also known as the bell curve and as the Gaussian distribution.
Rather than using data, the normal distribution is defined with a mathematical formula.

For any interval, a and b, the proportion of values in the itnerval can be computed using this formula.
We don't need to memorize or understand the details of the formula. R code can compute this for us.
Note that it is completely defined by just 2 parameters, m and s.  Thte reset of the symbols in the formula 
represent the interval ends, a and b, and known mathematical constants, pi and e.
m : the average or mean
s : the standard deviation of the distribution

The distribution is symmetric, centered at the average, and most values, about 95%, are within two standard 
deviations from the average.

>average <- sum(x) / length(x)
>SD <- sqrt( sum( (x-average)^2) / length(x))

You can think of this as the average distance between the values and their average.

computer the average and SD for the male heights, which we will store in x.
> index <- heights$sex=="Male"
> x <- heights$height[index]

> average <= mean(x)
> SD <- sd(x)
> c(average=average, SD = SD)
average	SD
69.31	3.61


The standard unit of value tells us how many standard deviations away from the average this value is.
For a value x, we define the standard unit as z equals x minus the average divided by the SD.
z = (x - average)/SD

For example, a person of average height means z = 0.  A person that is tall would be z = 2.
A person that is short would be z = -2. If in rare occurrences, a person is 7 foot tall, z > 3.

In R, to get the standard units using the function scale:
> z <- scale(x)

In our example, to see how many men are within two standard deviations from the average, now that we were already
converted to standard units, all we have to do is count the number of z's that are less than 2 and bigger
than negative 2, and then divide by the total.
So we take the mean of this quantity and we see that the proportion is 0.951
>mean(abs(z) < 2)
[1] 0.951
That is ~95%, which is what the normal distribution predicts.



-------------------------------------------------

library(dslabs)
data(heights)
x <- heights$height[heights$sex == "Male"]
mean(x > 69 & x <= 72)


Use the normal approximation to estimate the proportion the proportion of the data that is between 69 and 72 inches.
Note that you can't use x in your code, only avg and stdev. Also note that R has a function that may prove very 
helpful here - check out the pnorm function (and remember that you can get help by using ?pnorm).

library(dslabs)
data(heights)
x <- heights$height[heights$sex=="Male"]
avg <- mean(x > 69 & x <= 72)
stdev <- sd(x > 69 & x <= 72)
pnorm(x > 69 & x <= 72, avg, stdev)


Calculate ratio between two density

library(dslabs)
data(heights)
x <- heights$height[heights$sex == "Male"]
exact <- mean(x > 79 & x <= 81)
stdev <- sd(x > 79 & x <= 81)
approx <- pnorm(x > 79 & x <= 81)
exact/approx



First, we will estimate the proportion of adult men that are 7 feet tall or taller.

Assume that the distribution of adult men in the world as normally distributed with an average of 69 inches and a 
standard deviation of 3 inches.
Using this approximation, estimate the proportion of adult men that are 7 feet tall or taller, referred to as 
seven footers. Print out your estimate; don't store it in an object.
1- pnorm(84,69,3)


Now we have an approximation for the proportion, call it p, of men that are 7 feet tall or taller.
We know that there are about 1 billion men between the ages of 18 and 40 in the world, the age range for the NBA.
Can we use the normal distribution to estimate how many of these 1 billion men are at least seven feet tall?

Use your answer to the previous exercise to estimate the proportion of men that are seven feet tall or taller in 
the world and store that value as p.
Then round the number of 18-40 year old men who are seven feet tall or taller to the nearest integer. 
(Do not store this value in an object.)
p <- 1- pnorm(84,69,3)
round(p * 10^9)
287



There are about 10 National Basketball Association (NBA) players that are 7 feet tall or higher.
Use your answer to exercise 4 to estimate the proportion of men that are seven feet tall or taller in the world and 
store that value as p.
Use your answer to the previous exercise (exercise 5) to round the number of 18-40 year old men who are seven feet 
tall or taller to the nearest integer and store that value as N.
Then calculate the proportion of the world's 18 to 40 year old seven footers that are in the NBA. (Do not store 
this value in an object.)
p <- 1- pnorm(84,69,3)
N <- round(p * 10^9)
10/N



## Change the solution to previous answer
p <- 1 - pnorm(80, 69, 3)
N <- round(p * 10^9)
150/N
