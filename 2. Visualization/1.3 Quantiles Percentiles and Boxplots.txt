Quantile-Quantile Plots

If a distribution is well approximated by the normal distsribution, we can have a very useful and short summary.
To check if, in fact, it is a good approximation, we can use quantile-quantile plots, or q-q plots.

We start by defining a series of proportion, for example:
p = 0.05
p = 0.1
p = 0.15...0.95

Once this is defined for each p, we determine the value q, so that the proportion of the values 
in the data below q is p.
The q's are referred to as the quantiles.
Example:
For the male heights data, we have that 50% of the data is below 69.5 inches.
> mean(x <= 69.5)
[1] 0.515
This means that if p = 0.5, then q = 69.5.

If the quantiles of the data match the quantiles for the normal distribution, then it must be because the data
is approximated by a normal distribution.

> observed_quantiles <- quantile(x, p)

To obtain the theoretical normal distribution quantiles with the corresponding average and standard deviation, 
we use the qnorm function:
> theoretical_quantiles <- qnorm(p, mean = mean(x), sd = sd(x))

To see if they match or not, we can plot them against each other and draw an identiy line to see if the points 
fall on the line:
> plot(theoretical_quantiles, observed_quantiles)
> abline(0,1)

Note that the points fall almost on the line, meaning that the normal approximation is a pretty good approximation.

This will be simplier if we use standard units.  If we use standard units, we don't have to define the mean
and the SD in the fnction qnorm. And it will simplify and look like this:
> observed_quantiles <- quantile(z,p)
> theoretical_quantiles <- qnorm(p)
> plot(theoretical_quantiles, observed_quantiles)
> abline(0,1)

Percentiles


Percentiles are the special cases of quantiles that are commonly used.

p = 0.01
p = 0.02...0.99

p = 0.25
25th percentile

50th percentile also known as median.  Note that for the normal distribution, the median and the average are the same.
But this is not generally the case.

quartiles - which are obtained when we set 
p = 0.25
p = 0.50
p = 0.75

Boxplots

In the previous murders data, we have learned that the normal approximation does not apply here.
We can see it in the histogram and the qq plot.  In this case, the histogram or smooth density plot,
would serve as a relatively succinct summary.

Now suppose you were trying to describe this data to someone who is used to receiving just two numbers,
the average and the SD.  In this case, that's not an appropriate summary, but they still want something compact.

John Tookey's advice:
Provide a five number summary composed of the range along with the quartiles, 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile.
5 number summary:
  range
  quartiles
  
He also suggests that we ignore outlier when computing the range and instaed plot these as independent points.

Also suggests that we plot this five number summary as a box with whiskers.
The box is defined by the 25th and 75th percentiles and the whiskers are showing the range.
The distance between these two percentiles is called the interquartile range.
The two points that are outliers are shown separately and the median is shown with a horizontal line with the box.

From just a simple plot, we know that the median is about 2.5, that the distribution is not symmetic, and that
the range is 0 to 5 for the great majority of states with two exceptions, the two outliers.

Distribution of Female Heights

The exploratory plots reveal that the approximation is not as useful because we see the density plot has a second 
bump around 67. Looks like a little shoulder. Also the q-q plot shows that the highest points tend
to be taller than expected for the normal distribution.
So we should provide a histogram rather than just the average and SD for female heights.

If we look at the female heights distributions from other sources, other than our own data, we do find that
they are well approximated for the normal distribution.  So why did we see a second bump in our data?
Bad data? This is a good example of how data visualization has helped us discover a potential flaw in our data.

Assessment


Define a variable male that contains the male heights.
Define a variable female that contains the female heights.
Report the length of each variable.
library(dslabs)
data(heights)
male <- heights$height[heights$sex=="Male"]
female <- heights$height[heights$sex=="Female"]
length(male)
length(female)



Suppose we can't make a plot and want to compare the distributions side by side. If the number of data points 
is large, listing all the numbers is inpractical. A more practical approach is to look at the percentiles. We 
can obtain percentiles using the quantile function like this

library(dslabs)
data(heights)
quantile(heights$height, seq(.01, 0.99, 0.01))

Create two five row vectors showing the 10th, 30th, 50th, 70th, and 90th percentiles for the heights of each sex 
called these vectors female_percentiles and male_percentiles.
Then create a data frame called df with these two vectors as columns. The column names should be female and male 
and should appear in that order. As an example consider that if you want a data frame to have column names names 
and grades, in that order, you do it like this:
df <- data.frame(names = c("Jose", "Mary"), grades = c("B", "A"))
Take a look at the df by printing it. This will provide some information on how male and female heights differ.

library(dslabs)
data(heights)
male <- heights$height[heights$sex=="Male"]
female <- heights$height[heights$sex=="Female"]
male_percentiles <- quantile(male, c(0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9))
female_percentiles <- quantile(female, c(0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9))
df <- data.frame(female = female_percentiles, male = male_percentiles)
df


Study the boxplots summarizing the distributions of populations sizes by country.

Which continent has the country with the largest population size?
Asia

Which continent has median country with the largest population?
Africa

Again, look at the boxplots summarizing the distributions of populations sizes by country. To the nearest million, 
what is the median population size for Africa?
10 million

Examine the following boxplots and report approximately what proportion of countries in Europe have populations 
below 14 million:

America
