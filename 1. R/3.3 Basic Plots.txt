Basic Plots

R is flexible than Excel and faster to generate than D3.

create two objects and plot them in R
>population_in_millions <- murders$population/10^6
>total_gun_murders <- murders$total
>plot(population_in_millions, total_gun_murders)

histograms
>hist(murders$rate)
>murders$state[which.max(murders$rate)]
[1] "District of Columbia"

Boxplot - more terse summary than histogram, but they're easier to stack against each other.
So we can see many distributions in one plot.
Here we use them to compare the murder rates for different regions.
>boxplot(rate~region, data=murders)
The South has the highest murder rate of all regions.



# Load the datasets and define some variables
library(dslabs)
data(murders)

population_in_millions <- murders$population/10^6
total_gun_murders <- murders$total

plot(population_in_millions, total_gun_murders)

# Transform population using the log10 transformation and save to object log10_population
log10_population <- log10(murders$population)

# Transform total gun murders using log10 transformation and save to object log10_total_gun_murders
log10_total_gun_murders <- log10(murders$total)

# Create a scatterplot with the log scale transformed population and murders 
plot(log10_population, log10_total_gun_murders)


# Store the population in millions and save to population_in_millions 
population_in_millions <- murders$population/10^6


# Create a histogram of this variable
hist(population_in_millions)

# Create a boxplot of state populations by region for the murders dataset
boxplot(population~region, data=murders)
