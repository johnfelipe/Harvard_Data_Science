Vectors

which is the biggest state?
>murders$state[which.max(murders$population)]
[1] "California"

How many people does it have?
>max(murders$population)
[1] 37253956

In R, arithmetic operations on vectors occur element-wise.
Ex: we have heights in inches
>heights <- c(69,62,66,70,70,73,67,73,67,70)

Convert to cm
>heights * 2.54
...

If we want to compute how many inches taller or shorter than average,
we can subtract the average from every entry. ex: average is 69
>heights - 69
[1] 0 -7 -3 1 1 4 -2 4 -2 1

To compute the murder rate, murders for every 100,000 people (total divided by the population, multipled by 100,000)
>murder_rate <- murders$total/murders$population*100000
so the total for each state is going to be divided by the population for each state, element-wise, one by one.
And then multiply those values by 100,000 to get it in the right units.

Now look at the states ordered by murlder rate, in decresing order:
>murders$state[order(murder_rate, decreasing=TRUE)]

to create data frame:
> temp <- c(35, 88, 42, 84, 81, 30)
> city <- c("Beijing", "Lagos", "Paris", "Rio de Janeiro", "San Juan", "Toronto")
> city_temps <- data.frame(name = city, temperature = temp)

create numbers
> x <- (1:100)
compute sum  (ex: 1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^2 + ... + 1/100^2)
> sum(1/x^2)
