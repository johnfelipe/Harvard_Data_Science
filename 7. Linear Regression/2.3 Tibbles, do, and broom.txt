Advanced dplyr: Tibbles

Let's go back to baseball.
In a previous example, we estimated the regression lines
to predict runs from bases and balls in different home run strata.

We first constructed a data frame similar to this.

> dat <- Teams %>% filter(yearID %in% 1961:2001) %>%
+	mutate(HR = round(HR/G, 1),
+		BB = BB/G,
+		R = R/G) %>%
+	select(HR, BB, R) %>%
+	filter(HR >= 0.4 & HR <= 1.2)

Then, to compute the regression line in each strata, since we didn't know the lm function back then,
we used the formula directly like this.

> dat %>%
+	group_by(HR) %>%
+	summarize(slope = cor(BB,R)*sd(R/sd(BB))

We argued that the slopes are similar and that the differences were perhaps due to random variation.

To provide a more rigorous defense of the slopes
being the same, which is what led to our multivariate regression model,
we could compute confidence intervals for each slope.
We have not learned the formula for this, but the lm function provides enough information to construct them.

First, note that if we try to use the lm function to get the estimated slope like this, we don't get what we want.

> dat %>%
+	group_by(HR) %>%
+	lm(R ~ B, data = .) %>%
+	.$coef
(Intercept)	BB
2.199		0.638

The lm function ignored the group_by.

This is expected, because lm is not part of the tidyverse 
and does not know how to handle the outcome of group_by which is a group tibble.
We're going to describe tibbles in some details now.

When summarize receives the output of group_by, it somehow knows which rows of the table go with which groups.
But where is this information stored in the data frame?
Let's write some code to see the output of a group_by call.

> dat %>% group_by(HR) %>% head()
# A tibble: 6 x 3
#Groups: HR[5]
	HR	BB	R
	0.9	3.56	4.24
	0.7	3.97	4.47

Note that there are no columns with the information needed to define the groups.
But if you look closely at the output, you notice the line "A tibble, 6 by 3."
We can learn the class of the return object using this line of code, and we see that the class is a "tbl."

> dat %>% group_by(HR) %>% class()
[1] "grouped_df"	"tbl_df"	"tbl"	"data.frame"

This is pronounced "tibble."
It is also a tbl_df.
This is equivalent to tibble.

The tibble is a special kind of data frame.
We have seen them before, because tidyverse functions such as group_by 
and also summarize always return this type of data frame.
The group_by function returns a special kind of tibble, the grouped tibble.
We will say more about the grouped tibbles later.

Note that the manipulation verbs, select, filter, mutate, and arrange, don't necessarily return tibbles.
They preserve the class of the input.
If they receive a regular data frame, they return a regular data frame.
If they receive a tibble, they return a tibble.
But tibbles are the default data frame for the tidyverse.
Tibbles are very similar to data frames.
You can think of them as modern versions of data frames.
Next, we're going to describe briefly three important differences.


Q1:

What problem do we encounter when we try to run a linear model on our baseball data, grouping by home runs?

The lm function does not know how to handle grouped tibbles.


Q2:

Tibbles are similar to what other class in R?

Data frames 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Tibbles: Differences from Data Frames

In this video, we're going to describe some of the main differences between tibbles and data frames.

1) First, the print method for tibble is much more readable than that of a data frame.
To see this, type teams on your console after loading the Baseball Lahman Database.

> Teams

And you will see a very, very long list of columns and rows.
It's barely readable.
Teams is a data frame with many rows and columns.
That's why you see that.
Nevertheless, the output just shows everything wraps around and is hard to read.
It is so bad that we don't even print it here.
We'll let you print it on your own screen.

Now if you convert this data frame to a tibble data frame, the output is much more readable.
Here's an example.

> as_tibble(Teams)

That's the first main difference between tibbles and data frames.


2) A second one is that if you subset the columns of a data frame, you may get back an object that is not a data frame.
Here's an example.

> class(Teams[,20])
[1] "integer"

If we subset the 20th column, we get back an integer.
That's not a data frame.
With tibbles, this is not the case.
Here's an example.

> class(as tibble(Teams)[,20])
[1] "tbl_df"	"tbl"	"data.frame"

If we subset a tibble, we get back a tibble.
This is useful in the tidyverse since functions require data frames as input.

Now what if you want to access the original vector that defines a column in a tibble, for this, you actually
have to use the accessor dollar sign.
Here's an example.

> class(as_tibble(Teams)$HR)
[1] "integer"

A related feature to this is that tibbles will give you a warning if you try to access a column that does not exist.
That's not the case for data frames.
For example, if we accidentally write hr in lowercase instead of uppercase, with a data frame, all we get is a NULL.

> Teams$hr
NULL

No warning.
This can make it quite hard to debug code.
In contrast, if it's a tibble, and you try to access the lowercase hr column, which doesn't exist,
you actually get a warning.

> as_tibble(Teams)$hr
NULL
Warning message:
Unknown or uninitialized column: 'hr'.

3) A third difference is that while columns of a data frame need to be a vector of number strings or Boolean,
tibbles can have more complex objects, such as lists or functions.
Also note that we can create tibbles with the tibble function.
So, look at this line of code.

> tibble(id = c(1,2,3), func = c(mean, median, sd))
# A tibble: 3 x 2
	id	func
	1	<fn>
	2	<fn>
	3	<fn>

We're creating a column that actually has functions in it.
You can see the output here.

4) Finally, the last difference we describe is that tibbles can be grouped.
The function group by returns a special kind of tibble, a grouped tibble.
This class stores information that lets you know which rows are in which groups.
The tidyverse functions, in particular the summarize functions, are aware of the group information.
In the example we showed, we saw that the lm function, which is not part of the tidyverse, does not
know how to deal with group tibbles.
The object is basically converted to a regular data frame, and then the function runs ignoring the groups.
This is why we only get one pair of estimates, as we see here.

> dat %>%
+	group_by(HR) %>%
+	lm(R ~ BB, data = .)

Call:
lm(formula = R ~ BB, data = .)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)	BB
2.199		0.638

To make these non-tidyverse function better integrate with a tidyverse,
we will learn a new function, the function do().

Q1:

What are some advantages of tibbles compared to data frames?

Tibbles display better.
If you subset a tibble, you always get back a tibble.
Tibbles can have complex entries.
Tibbles can be grouped.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

do

In this video, we'll describe the very useful do( ) function.
The tidyverse functions know how to interpret group tibbles.
Furthermore, to facilitate stringing commands through the pipe, tidyverse function consistently return data frames.
Since this assures that the output of 1 is accepted as the input of another.

But most our functions do not recognize group tibbles,
nor do they return data frames.
The lm( ) function is an example.
The do( ) function serves as a bridge between our functions, such as lm( ) and the tidyverse.
The do( ) function understands group tibbles and always returns a data frame.
So let's try to use the do( ) function to fit a regression line to each home run strata.
We would do it like this.

> dat %>%
+	group_by(HR) %>%
+	do(fit = lm(R ~ BB, data = .))
Source: local data frame [9 x 2]
Groups: <by row>

# A tibble: 9 x 2
	HR	fit
	0.4	<S3: lm>
	0.5	<S3: lm>
	0.6	<S3: lm>

Notice that we did in fact fit a regression line to each strata.
But the do( ) function would create a data frame with the first column being the strata value.
And a column named fit.
We chose that name.
It could be any name.
And that column will contain the result of the lm( ) call.
Therefore, the return table has a column with lm( ) objects in the cells, which is not very useful.
*Also note that if we do not name a column, then do( ) will return the actual output of lm( ), not a data frame.
And this will result in an error since do( ) is expecting a data frame as output.
If you write this, you will get the following error.

> dat %>% 
+	group_by(HR) %>%
+	do(lm(R ~ BB, data = .))
Error: Results 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... must be data frames, no lm

For a useful data frame to be constructed, the output of the function, inside do( ), must be a data frame as well.
We could build a function that returns only what you want in the form of a data frame.
We could write for example, this function.

> get_slope <- function(data) {
+	fit <- lm(R ~ BB, data = data)
+	data.frame(slope = fit$coefficients[2],
+		se = summary(fit)$coefficient[2,2])
+ }

And then we use to do( ) without naming the output, since we are already getting a data frame.
We can write this very simple piece of code and now we get the expected result. We get the slope for each strata
and the standard error for that slope.

> dat %>%
+	group_by(HR) %>%
+	do(get_slope(.))
# A tibble: 9 x 3
# Groups: HR [9]
	HR	slope	se
	0.4	0.734	0.208


If we name the output, then we get a column containing the data frame.
So if we write this piece of code, now once again, we get one of these complex tibbles with a column
having a data frame in each cell.

> dat %>%
+	group_by(HR) %>%
+	do(slope = get_slope(.))
Source: local data frame [9 x 2]
Groups: <by row>
# A tibble: 9 x 2
	HR	slope
	0.4	<data.frame [1 x 2]>
	0.5	<data.frame [1 x 2]>

Which is again, not very useful.
All right.

Now we're going to cover one last feature of do( ).
If the data frame being returned has more than one row, these will be concatenated appropriately.
Here's an example in which return both estimated parameters.
The slope and intercept.
We write this piece of code.

> get_lse <- function(data) {
+	fit <- lm(R ~ BB, data = data)
+	data.frame(term = names(fit$coefficients),
+		slope = fit$coefficients,
+		se = summary(fit)$coefficient[,2]
+ }
> dat %>%
+	group_by(HR) %>%
+	do(get_lse(.))
# A tibble: 18 x 4
# Groups: HR [9]
	HR	term		slope	se
	0.4	(Intercept)	1.36	0.631
	0.4	BB		0.734	0.208
	0.5	(Intercept)	2.01	0.344
	0.5	BB		0.566	0.110

And now we use the do( ) function as we used it before,
and get a very useful tibble, giving us the estimates of the slope
and intercept, as well as the standard errors.
Now, if you think this is all a bit too complicated, you're not alone.
To simplify things, we're going to introduce the broom package,
which was designed to facilitate the use of model fitting functions such as lm() with the tidyverse.


Q1:

What are two advantages of the do command, when applied to the tidyverse?

It understands grouped tibbles.
It always returns a data.frame.

Q2:

You want to take the tibble dat, which we’ve been using in this video, and run the linear model R ~ BB for each 
strata of HR. Then you want to add three new columns to your grouped tibble: the coefficient, standard error, 
and p-value for the BB term in the model.
You’ve already written the function get_slope, shown below.

get_slope <- function(data) {
  fit <- lm(R ~ BB, data = data)
  sum.fit <- summary(fit)

  data.frame(slope = sum.fit$coefficients[2, "Estimate"], 
             se = sum.fit$coefficients[2, "Std. Error"],
             pvalue = sum.fit$coefficients[2, "Pr(>|t|)"])
}

dat %>% 
  group_by(HR) %>% 
  do(get_slope(.))
  
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

broom

The original task we ask for in a previous video was to provide an estimate and a confidence interval
for the slope estimates of each strata.
The broom packs will make this quite easy.

Broom has three main functions all of which extract information from the object returned by the function LM,
and return it in a tidy verse friendly data frame.
These functions are tidy(), glance() and augment().

The tidy function returns estimates and related information as a data frame.
Here's an example.

> library(broom)
> fit <- lm(R ~ BB, data = dat)
> tidy(fit)
		term	estimate	std.error	statistic	p.value
	(Intercept)	2.199		0.1135		19.4		1.06e-70
	BB		0.638		0.0344		18.5		1.37e-65

We can add other important summaries, such as confidence intervals, using arguments like this.

> tidy(fit, conf.int = TRUE)
		term	estimate	std.error	statistic	p.value		conf.low	conf.high
	(Intercept)	2.199		0.1135		19.4		1.06e-70	1.98		2.421
	BB		0.638		0.0344		18.5		1.37e-65	0.57		0.705	

Because the outcome is a data frame, we can immediately use it with do() to string together the commands that
produce the table we are after.
So this piece of code will generate what we wanted to see.

> dat %>%
+	group_by(HR) %>%
+	do(tidy(lm(R ~ BB, data = .), conf.int = TRUE))
# A tibble: 18 x 8
# Groups: HR [9]
	HR	term	estimate	std.error	statistic 	p.value 	conf.low	conf.high

Because a data frame is returned, we can filter and select the rows and columns we want.
So this simple piece of code gives us exactly the table we asked for.

> dat %>%
+	group_by(HR) %>%
+	do(tidy(lm(R ~ BB, data = .), conf.int = TRUE)) %>%
+	filter(term == "BB") %>%
+	select(HR, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
# A tibble: 9 x 4
# Groups: HR [9]
	HR	estimate	conf.low	conf.high

We have filtered away the intercept rows, and only show the columns we
care about, the estimate and the confidence intervals.

Furthermore, a table like this makes visualization with GE plot quite easy.
So this piece of code produces this nice plot, which provides very useful information.

> dat %>%
+	group_by(HR) %>%
+	do(tidy(lm(R ~ BB, data = .), conf.int = TRUE) %>%
+	filter(term == "BB") %>%
+	select(HR, estimate, conf.low, conf.high) %>%
+	ggplot(aes(HR, y = estimate, ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
+	geom_errorbar() + 
+	geom_point()

Now we return to discussing our original task of determining if slopes change.
The plot we just made using do and broom shows that the confidence
intervals overlap, which provides a nice visual confirmation
that our assumption that the slopes do not change with home run strata, is relatively safe.

Earlier we mentioned two other functions from the broom package, glance
and augment.
Glance and augment relate to model specific and observation specific outcomes, respectively.

glance(): model-specific outcomes

augment(): observation-specific outcome

Here we can see the model fit summary the glance returns.

> glance(fit)
r.squared	adj.r.squared	sigma	statistics	p.value		df	logLik	AIC	BIC	deviance	df.residual

You can learn more about these summaries in any regression textbook.
We'll see an example of augment in a future video.


Q1:

The output of a broom function is always what?

A data.frame


Q2:

You want to know whether the relationship between home runs and runs per game varies by baseball league. You create the following dataset:

dat <- Teams %>% filter(yearID %in% 1961:2001) %>%
  mutate(HR = HR/G,
         R = R/G) %>%
  select(lgID, HR, BB, R) 
What code would help you quickly answer this question?

dat %>% 
  group_by(lgID) %>% 
  do(tidy(lm(R ~ HR, data = .), conf.int = T)) %>% 
  filter(term == "HR")
