Motivating Example; Moneyball

As motivation for this course, we'll go back to 2002 and try to build a baseball team with a limited budget.
Note that in 2002, the Yankees payroll was almost $130 million, 
and had more than tripled the Oakland A's $40 million budget.

Statistics have been used in baseball since its beginnings.
Note that the data set we will be using, included in the Lahman Library, goes back to the 19th century.

For example, a summary of statistics we will describe soon,
the batting average (BA), has been used to summarize a batter's success for decades.

Other statistics such as home runs, runs batted in, and stolen bases, we'll describe all this soon, are reported
for each player in the game summaries included in the sports section of newspapers.
And players are rewarded for high numbers.
Although summary statistics were widely used in baseball, data analysis per se was not.
These statistics were arbitrarily decided on without much thought as to whether they actually predicted,
or were related to helping a team win.

This all changed with Bill James.
In the late 1970s, this aspiring writer and baseball fan started publishing articles describing more in-depth analysis
of baseball data.
He named the approach of using data to predict what outcomes best predict if a team wins sabermetrics.
Until Billy Beane made sabermetrics the center of his baseball operations,
Bill James' work was mostly ignored by the baseball world. Today, pretty much every team uses the approach,
and it has gone beyond baseball into other sports.
In this course, to simplify the example we use, we'll focus on predicting scoring runs.

We will ignore pitching and fielding, although those are important as well.
We will see how regression analysis can help develop strategies to build a competitive baseball
team with a constrained budget.
The approach can be divided into two separate data analyses.
In the first, we determine which recorded player specific statistics predict runs.
In the second, we examine if players were undervalued based on what our first analysis predicts.

Baseball Basics


We actually don't need to understand all the details about the game of baseball,
which has over 100 rules, to see how regression will help us find undervalued players.
Here, we distill the sport to the basic knowledge one
needs to know to effectively attack the data science challenge.
Let's get started.

The goal of a baseball game is to score more runs, they're like points, than the other team.
Each team has nine batters that bat in a predetermined order.
After the ninth batter hits, we start with the first again.

Each time they come to bat, we call it a plate appearance, PA.
At each plate appearance, the other team's pitcher throws the ball and you try to hit it.
The plate appearance ends with a binary outcome-- you either make an out, that's a failure and sit back down,
or you don't, that's a success and you get to run around the bases and potentially score a run.

Each team gets nine tries, referred to as innings, to score runs.
Each inning ends after three outs, after you've failed three times.
From these examples, we see how luck is involved in the process.
When you bat you want to hit the ball hard.
If you hit it hard enough, it's a home run, the best possible outcome as you get at least one automatic run.
But sometimes, due to chance, you hit the ball very hard and a defender catches it, which makes it an out, a failure.
In contrast, sometimes you hit the ball softly but it lands just in the right place.
You get a hit which is a success.

The fact that there is chance involved hints at why probability models will be involved in all this.
Now there are several ways to succeed.
Understanding this distinction will be important for our analysis.

When you hit the ball you want to pass as many bases as possible.
There are four bases with the fourth one called home plate.
Home plate is where you start, where you try to hit.
So the bases form a cycle.
If you get home, you score a run.
We're simplifying a bit.

5 ways to succeed:
1. baseball on balls (BB)
2. single
3. double (X2B)
4. triple (X3B)
5. home run (HR)


But there are five ways you can succeed.
In other words, not making an out.
First one is called a base on balls.
This is when the pitcher does not pitch well and you get to go to first base.
A single is when you hit the ball and you get to first base.
A double is when you hit the ball and you go past first base to second.
Triple is when you do that but get to third.
And a home run is when you hit the ball and go all the way home and score a run.

If you get to a base, you still have a chance
of getting home and scoring a run if the next batter hits successfully.
While you are on base, you can also try to steal a base.
If you run fast enough, you can try to go from first to second or from second to third 
without the other team tagging you.

All right.
Now historically, the batting average has been considered the most important offensive statistic.
To define this average, we define a hit and an at bat (AB).
Singles, doubles, triples, and home runs are hits.
But remember, there's a fifth way to be successful, the base on balls.
That is not a hit.

An at bat is the number of times you either get a hit or make an out, bases on balls are excluded.
The batting average is simply hits divided by at bats.

batting average = H / AB

And it is considered the main measure of a success rate.
Today, in today's game, this success rates ranges from player to player from about 20% to 38%.
We refer to the batting average in thousands.
So for example, if your success rate is 25% we say you're batting 250.

One of Bill James' first important insights
is that the batting average ignores bases on balls but bases on balls is a success.
So a player that gets many more bases on balls than the average player
might not be recognized if he does not excel in batting average.
But is this player not helping produce runs?
No award is given to the player with the most bases on balls.

In contrast, the total number of stolen bases are considered important
and an award is given out to the player with the most.
But players with high totals of stolen bases also make outs as they do not always succeed.
So does a player with a high stolen base total help produce runs?
Can we use data size to determine if it's better to pay for bases on balls or stolen bases?

One of the challenges in this analysis is that it is not obvious
how to determine if a player produces runs because so much depends on his teammates.
We do keep track of the number of runs scored by our player.
But note that if you hit after someone who hits many home runs, you will score many runs.
But these runs don't necessarily happen if we hire this player but not his home run hitting teammate.
However, we can examine team level statistics.
How do teams with many stolen bases compare to teams with few?
How about bases on balls?
We have data.
Let's examine some.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bases on Balls or Stolen Bases?

Let's start looking at some baseball data and try to answer your questions using these data.
First one, do teams that hit more home runs score more runs?

We know what the answer to this will be, but let's look at the data anyways.
We're going to examine data from 1961 to 2001.
We end at 2001 because, remember, we're back in 2002, getting ready to build a team.
We started in 1961, because that year, the league changed from 154 games to 162 games.
The visualization of choice when exploring
the relationship between two variables like home runs and runs is a scatterplot.
The following code shows you how to make that scatterplot.

> library(Lahman)
> ds_theme_set()
> Teams %>% filter(yearID %in% 1961:2001) %>%
+ 	mutate(HR_per_game = HR/G, R_per_game = R/G) %>%
+	ggplot(aes(HR_per_game, R_per_game)) +
+ 	geom_point(alpha = 0.5)


We start by loading the Lahman library that has all these baseball statistics.
And then we simply make a scatterplot using 2d plot.
Here's a plot of runs per game versus home runs per game.
The plot shows a very strong association-- teams with more home runs tended to score more runs.
Now, let's examine the relationship between stolen bases and wins.

> library(Lahman)
> ds_theme_set()
> Teams %>% filter(yearID %in% 1961:2001) %>%
+ 	mutate(SB_per_game = SB/G, R_per_game = R/G) %>%
+	ggplot(aes(SB_per_game, R_per_game)) +
+ 	geom_point(alpha = 0.5)


Here are the runs per game plotted against stolen bases per game.
Here, the relationship is not as clear.
Finally, let's examine the relationship between bases on balls and runs.

> library(Lahman)
> ds_theme_set()
> Teams %>% filter(yearID %in% 1961:2001) %>%
+ 	mutate(BB_per_game = BB/G, R_per_game = R/G) %>%
+	ggplot(aes(BB_per_game, R_per_game)) +
+ 	geom_point(alpha = 0.5)


Here are runs per game versus bases on balls per game.
Although the relationship is not as strong as it was for home runs, we do see a pretty strong relationship here.

We know that, by definition, home runs cause runs, because when you hit a home run, at least one run will score.
Now it could be that home runs also cause the bases on balls.
If you understand the game, you will agree with me that that could be the case.
So it might appear that a base on ball is causing runs, when in fact, it's home runs that's causing both.
This is called confounding.

An important concept you will learn about.
Linear regression will help us parse all this out and quantify the associations.
This will then help us determine what players to recruit.
Specifically, we will try to predict things like how many more runs will the team score if we
increase the number of bases on balls but keep the home runs fixed.
Regression will help us answer this question, as well.
