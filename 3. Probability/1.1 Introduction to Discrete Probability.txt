Discrete Probability

probability of an event:
proportion of times the events occurs when we repeat the experiment over and over, independently and under the same
conditions.

Monte Carlo Simulations

Sample()
Random number generators permit us to mimic the process of picking at random.

First, use the rep function to generate the urn:
> beads <- rep( c("red","blue"), times= c(2,3))
> beads
[1] 	"red"	"red"	"blue"	"blue"	blue"
> sample(beads, 1)
[1] 	"blue"
This creates one random outcome.

Monte Carlo Simulation - Repeat the experiment a large enough number of times to make the results practically
equivalent to doing it over and over forever.
But what is "large enough"?

To perform our first Monte Carlo simulation, we use replicate().
> B <- 10000
> events <- replicate(B, sample(beads, 1))

We can use tables to see the distribution:
> tab <- table(events)
> tab
events
blue	red
5962	4038

Then use prop.table to give us the proportions
> prop.table(tab)
events
blue	red
0.5962	0.4038

And we see that, in fact, the Morte Carlo simulation gives a very good approximation with 0.5962 for blue and
0.4038 for red.


We don't actually have to use replicate in this particular example.  This is because the function sample has an 
argument that permits us to pick more than one element from the urn.
However, by default, this selection occurs without replacement.  After a bead is selected, it is not put back in
the urn.

What if we randomlyh select 5 beads over and over again, let's do it 3 times.
> sample(beads, 5)
[1]	"blue"	"red"	"red"	"blue"	"blue"
> sample(beads, 5)
[1]	"blue"	"blue"	"blue"	"red"	"red"
> sample(beads, 5)
[1]	"red"	"blue"	"blue"	"blue"	"red"

This results in a rearrangement that always has three blue and two red beads.


>sample(beads, 6)
error, you don't have enough beads in here to get six.  This is because it is doing it WITHOUT REPLACEMENT.

We can get samples WITH replacement.
> events <- sample(beads, B, replace = TRUE)
> prop.table(table(events))
events
blue	red
0.6039	0.3961

We see that we get very similar answers to what we got using the replicate function.

Probability Distributions

Defining a distribution for categorical outcomes is relatively straight forward.
We simply assign a probability to each category.
In cases that can be thought of as beads in an urn, for each bead type, the proportion defines the distribution.

If you're are randomly calling likely voters from a population that has 44% Democrat, 44% Republican, 10% undecided, 
and 2% green, these proportions define the probability for each group.
For this example, the probability distribution is simply these four proportions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Independence

two events are independent if the outcome of one does not affect the outcome of the other.
ie, coin tosses
Pr(heads) = 0.5

Examples of events that are not independent come from card games.
When we deal the first card, the probability of getting a king is 1 in 13.  This is because there are 13 possibilities.

Now if we deal a king for the first card and don't replace it, then the probability of getting a king in the second
card is less because there are only three kings left.
The probability is 3 out of not 52, but out of 51.
These events are therefore not independent.

Back to the bead example, what if we pick beads without replacement.
> x <- sample(beads, 5)
> x[2:5]
[1]	"blue"	"blue"	"blue"	"red"

you can see the three blue beads have already come out.  This affects the probability of the first.  They are not
independent.
The probabilities change once you see the other outcomes.

When events are not independent, conditional probabilities are useful and necessary to make correct calculations.
Pr(Card 2 is a king | Card 1 is a king) = 3/51
| means "givent that" or "conditional on"

if A and B are independent:
Pr(A|B) = Pr(A)
It doesnt matter what B is.


If we want to know that probability of two events, say A and B, occuring, we can use the multiplication rule.

The probability of A and B is equal to the probability of A multiplied by the probability of B given that
A already happened.
Pr(A and B) = Pr(A)Pr(B|A)


Ex, In blackjack, you get assigned two random cards without replacement. Then, you can ask for more. The goal is to 
get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over.
So, in blackjack, to calculate the chances of getting 21, in the following way, first we get an ace
and then we get a face card or a 10, we compute the problem of the first being an ace and then multiply by the 
probability of a face card or a 10 given that the first card was an ace.

(chance of getting an ace) x (the chance of getting a card with value 10)
Given that we already saw an ace, so it's 16 out of 51.
1/13 x 16/51 ~~ 0.02

The multiplicative rule also applies to more than two events.  We can use induction to expand for more than two.
So the probability of A and B and C is equal to the probability of A times the probability of B given that A 
happened times the probability of C that A and b happened.
Pr(A and B and C) = Pr(A)Pr(B|A)Pr(C|A and B)

For independent events, the multiplication rule becomes simpler.  We simply multiply the three probabilities.
Pr(A and B and C) = Pr(A)Pr(B)Pr(C)


Becareful not to assume independence when we don't actually have independence. 
For example:
Imagine a court case in which the suspect was described to have a mustache and a beard, and the prosecution 
brings in an expert to argue that, because 1 in 10 men have beards and 1 in 5 men has mustaches, using the 
multiplication rule, this means that only 2% of men have both beards and mustaches-- 1/10 times 1/5.
1/10 x 1/5 = 0.02
Assuming independence is clearly not true.
The conditional probability of a man having a mustache conditional on them having a beard is quite high.
Pr(mustache|beard) = 0.95
That's 95%.
So the correct calculation actually give us a much high probably, it's 9%.
Pr(mustache and beard) ~~ 0.09

Assessment


Probability of cyan
One ball will be drawn at random from a box containing: 3 cyan balls, 5 magenta balls, and 7 yellow balls.
What is the probability that the ball will be cyan?
3/15


Probability of not cyan
One ball will be drawn at random from a box containing: 3 cyan balls, 5 magenta balls, and 7 yellow balls.
What is the probability that the ball will not be cyan?
12/15

Sampling without replacement
Instead of taking just one draw, consider taking two draws. You take the second draw without returning the 
first draw to the box. We call this sampling without replacement.
What is the probability that the first draw is cyan and that the second draw is not cyan?
3/15 x 12/14 = 36/210


Now repeat the experiment, but this time, after taking the first draw and recording the color, return it 
back to the box and shake the box. We call this sampling with replacement.
What is the probability that the first draw is cyan and that the second draw is not cyan?
3/15 x 12/15 = 36/225


In the edX exercises for this section, we calculated some probabilities by hand. Now we'll calculate those 
probabilities using R.
One ball will be drawn at random from a box containing: 3 cyan balls, 5 magenta balls, and 7 yellow balls.
What is the probability that the ball will be cyan?
Define a variable p as the probability of choosing a cyan ball from the box.
Print the value of p.
cyan <- 3
magenta <- 5
yellow <- 7
# Assign a variable `p` as the probability of choosing a cyan ball from the box
p <- cyan / (cyan + magenta + yellow)
# Print the variable `p` to the console
p


We defined the variable p as the probability of choosing a cyan ball from a box containing: 3 cyan balls, 
5 magenta balls, and 7 yellow balls.
What is the probability that the ball you draw from the box will NOT be cyan?
Using the probability of choosing a cyan ball, p, calculate the probability of choosing any other ball.
# `p` is defined as the probability of choosing a cyan ball from a box containing: 3 cyan balls, 5 magenta balls, and 7 yellow balls.
# Using variable `p`, calculate the probability of choosing any ball that is not cyan from the box
1-p


Instead of taking just one draw, consider taking two draws. You take the second draw without returning the first 
draw to the box. We call this sampling without replacement.
What is the probability that the first draw is cyan and that the second draw is not cyan?
Calculate the probability of choosing a ball that is not cyan after one cyan ball has been removed from the box.
Calculate probability of two sequential actions occuring: choosing a cyan ball on the first draw and a ball that 
is not cyan on the second draw.
cyan <- 3
magenta <- 5
yellow <- 7
# The variable `p_1` is the probability of choosing a cyan ball from the box on the first draw.
p_1 <- cyan / (cyan + magenta + yellow)
# Assign a variable `p_2` as the probability of not choosing a cyan ball on the second draw without replacement.
p_2 <- (magenta + yellow) / (cyan + magenta + yellow -1)
# Calculate the probability that the first draw is cyan and the second draw is not cyan.
p_1 * p_2


Now repeat the experiment, but this time, after taking the first draw and recording the color, return it back to 
the box and shake the box. We call this sampling with replacement.
What is the probability that the first draw is cyan and that the second draw is not cyan?
Calculate probability of two independent actions occuring: choosing a cyan ball on the first draw and a ball that 
is not cyan on the second draw, after replacing the first ball.
cyan <- 3
magenta <- 5
yellow <- 7
# The variable 'p_1' is the probability of choosing a cyan ball from the box on the first draw.
p_1 <- cyan / (cyan + magenta + yellow)
# Assign a variable 'p_2' as the probability of not choosing a cyan ball on the second draw with replacement.
p_2 <- (magenta + yellow) / (cyan + magenta + yellow)
# Calculate the probability that the first draw is cyan and the second draw is not cyan.
p_1 * p_2
