Continuous Probabilty

Earlier we explained why when summarizing a list of numeric values such as heights,
it's not useful to construct a distribution that assigns a proportion to each possible outcome.

Note, for example, that if we measure every single person in a very large population with extremely high precision,
because no two people are exactly the same height, we would need to assign a proportion to each observed value
and attain no useful summary at all.

Similarly when defining probability distributions, it is not useful to assign a very small probability to every 
single height.

Just like when using distributions to summarize numeric data, it is much more practical to define a function that 
operates on intervals rather than single values.

The standard way of doing this is using the cumulative distribution function.

We previously described the empirical cumulative distribution function-- eCDF-- as a basic summary of a list of 
numeric values.

> library(tidyverse)
> library(dslabs)
> data(heights)
> x <- heights %>% filter(sex=="Male") %>% .height

Now define the empirical distribution function:
> F <- function(a) mean(x<=a)
We just count the number of cases where x is smaller or equal to a and divide by n. We take the mean, that's the
proportion of cases.

So for every value of a, this gives a proportion of values in the list x that are smaller or equal to a.

Let's introduce probability.
For example, let's ask if I pick one of the male students at random, what is the chance that the is taller 
than 70.5 inches?
Because every student has the same chance of being picked, the answer to this question is the proportion
of studens that are taller than 70.5.

Using eCDF, we obtain the answer.
> 1 - F(70)
[1] 0.3768473

Once the CDF is defined, we can use this to compute the probability of any subset.
For example, the probability of a student being between the height a and the height b is simply 
f(b) - f(a)

Because we can compute the probability for any possible event this way, the cumulative probability function 
defines a probability distribution for picking a height at random from our vector of heights x.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Theoretical Distribution

The cumulative distribution for the normal distribution is defined by a mathematical formula.
In R, use pnorm()

F(a) = pnorm(a, avg, s)

A random quantity is normally distributed with average (avg) and standard deviation (s), if it's probability
distribution is defined by f(a)= pnorm(a, avg, s)

This is useful, because if we are going to use the normal approximation for say, height, we don't need the 
entire dataset to answer questions such as, what is the probability that a randomly selected
student is taller than 70.5 inches. We just need the average height and the standard deviation.

> 1-pnorm(70.5, mean(x), sd(x))
[1] 0.37


The normal distribution is derived mathematically. Apart from computing the average in the standard deviation,
we don't use data to define it.

Also the normal distribution is defined for continuous variables. It is not described for discrete variables.
However, for practicing data scientists, pretty much everything we do involves data, which is technically 
speaking discrete.

For example, we could consider our adult data categorical with each specific height a unique category.
The probability distribution would then be defined by the proportion of students reporting each of those 
unique heights.
>plot(prop.table(table(x)), xlab = "a = Height in inches", ylab = "Pr(X = a)")

So each reported height gets a probability defined by the proportion of students reporting it.

One student reported their height as 69.6850393700787 inches which is 177 cm.
The probability of this height is 0.001.  That's 1 in 708.
However the probability for 70 inches is 0.12.

Clearly, it is much more useful for data analytic purposes to treat this outcome as a continuous numeric variable.
But keep in mind not many people are exactly 70 inches.

With continuous distributions, the probability of a singular value is not even defined.
For example, it does not make sense to ask what is the probability that a normally distributed value is 70.
Instead, we define probabilities for intervals.

So we could ask instead, what is a probability that someone is between 69.99 and 70.01.

In cases like height in which the data is rounded, the normal approximation is particularly useful
if we deal with intervals that include exactly one round number. So for example, the normal distribution is
useful for approximating the proportion of students reporting between 69.5 and 70.5.

This is using actual data:
> mean(x <= 68.5) - mean(x <= 67.5)
[1] 0.114532
> mean(x <= 69.5) - mean(x <= 68.5)
[1] 0.1194581
> mean(x <= 70.5) - mean(x <= 69.5)
[1] 0.1219212

This is using the approximation:
> pnorm(68.5, mean(x), sd(x)) - pnorm(67.5, mena(x), sd(x))
[1] 0.1031077
> pnorm(69.5, mean(x), sd(x)) - pnorm(68.5, mena(x), sd(x))
[1] 0.1097121
> pnorm(70.5, mean(x), sd(x)) - pnorm(69.5, mena(x), sd(x))
[1] 0.1081743

We get almost the same values.

But not useful for intervals that don't include an integer:
> mean(x <= 70.9) - mean(x <= 70.1)
[1] 0.02216749
> pnorm(70.9, mean(x), sd(x)) - pnorm(70.1, mean(x), sd(x))
[1] 0.08359562

This situation is called discretization.
Although the true height distribution is continuous, the reported heights tend to be more common at discrete values,
in this case, due to rounding.
As long as we are aware of how to deal with this reality, the normal approximation can still be a very useful tool.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Probability density

For categorical data, we can define the probability of a category.
For example, a roll of a die, let's call it x, can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
The probably of 4 is defined as probability of x equals 4 is 1/6.
Pr(X = 4) = 1/6

The CDF can be defined by adding up probability:
F(4) = Pr(X <= 4) = 
	Pr(X = 4) + Pr(X = 3) + Pr(X = 2) + Pr(X = 1)
	

In contrast, for continuous distributions, the probability of a single value is not defined.
However, there is a theoretical definition that has a similar interpretation.

The probability density at x is defined as the function
F(a) = Pr(X <= a) = Integral  f(x) dx

We're going to call it little f of x, such that the probability distribution
big F of a, which is the probability of x being less than or equal to a,
is the integral of all values up to a of little f of x dx.

For those that know calculus, remember, that the integral is related to a sum.
It's the sum of bars with widths that are approximating 0.

If you don't know calculus, you can think of little f of x as a curve for which the area under the curve up 
to the value a gives you the probability of x being less than or equal to a.

For example, to use the normal approximation to estimate the probability of someone being taller than 76 inches,
we can use the probability density.
> avg <- mena(x)
> s <- sd(x)
> 1 - pnorm(76, avg, s)
[1] 0.03206008

The curve you see is a probability density function for the normal distribution.

In R, you get the probability density function for the normal distirubtion using dnorm.  D stands for density.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monte Carlo Simulations

Run Monte Carlo simulations using normally distributed variables.

rnorm - a function to generate normally distributed outcomes.  It takes size, avg, and sd and produces
these random numbes.

An example to generate data that looks like our reported heights.
> x <- heights %>% filter(sex == "Male") %>% .$height
> n <- length(x)
> avg <- mean(x)
> s <- sd(x)
> simulated_heights <- rnorm(n, avg, s)

This used the rnorm to generate the randomly distributed outcome.

> ds_theme_set()
> data.frame(simulated_heights = simulated_heights) %>% ggplot(aes(simulated_heights)) +
+	geom_histogram(color="black", binwidth = 2)

It mimics natually occurring events

Let's ask if we pick 800 males at random, how rare is that the tallest person is a seven footer?

> B <- 10000
> tallest <- replicate(B, {
+	simulated_data <- rnorm(800, avg, s)
+	max(simulated_data)
+ })


We're going to run 10,000 simulations, and for each one,
we're going to generate 800 normally distributed values,
pick the tallest one, and return that.

Now ask what proportion of these simulations return a seven footer as the tallest person?
> mean(tallest >= 7*12)
[1] 0.019

Other Continuous Distributions

The normal distribution is not the only useful theoretical distribution.
Other continuous distributions that we may encounter are student-t, the chi-squared, the exponential, the gamma,
and the beta distribution.

R provides functions to compute the density, the quantiles,
the cumulative distribution function, and to generate
Monte Carlos simulations for all these distributions.
R uses a convention that lets us remember the names of these functions.
Namely, using the letters d for density, q
for quantile, p for probability density function, and r for random.

dnorm, pnorm, and rnorm.

To see the math that explains why the answers to the previous exercises are the same, suppose we have a random variable with expected value µ and standard error s. Suppose we ask the probability of X being smaller or equal to a. Remember that, by definition, a is (a-µ)/s standard deviations s away from the average µ. The probability is:

Pr(X=a)
Now we subtract µ to both sides and then divide both sides by s:

Pr(X-µs=a-µs)
The quantity on the right is a standard normal random variable. It has an average of 0 and a standard error of 1. We will call it Z:

Pr(Z=a-µs)
So, no matter the units, the probability of X=a is the same as the probability of a standard normal variable being less than (a-µ)/s. If mu is the average and sigma the standard error, which of the following R code would therefore give us the right answer in every situation:
pnorm((a-mu)/sigma)
